Looking to get started using https://medium.freecodecamp.com/. I'm excited to learn that they offer actual projects for non profits instead of just completing a basic project from a book. I learned how to progam in VBA for excel from a previous job and found that i learned best from trial and error. Some of the books I've tried to learn left me feeling like I was just going through the paces.
